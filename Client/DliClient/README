Introduction
------------
This DliClient is based on the ZSI library to access web services from python.
In this repository we include a (working) tarball with ZSI code, but ZSI is a
different project, whose code (and more information, etc.) can be obtained from:
http://pywebsvcs.sourceforge.net/.

Contents
--------
Files in this CVS module (apart from ZSI.tar.gz):

  dliClient_types.py:  some classes required to be able to talk to the DLI web server
  dliClient.py:  DliClient class, main API to be used
  dli-list:   tool that uses dli_client.py to query the DLI interface

Setup
-----
If you just copy everything to the same dir, untar the ZSI.tar.gz, and execute:
   ./dli-list <lfn>
You should get the associated SEs.

If you are not in the same dir where ZSI resides (or the dli_* files), then you need
to setup PYTHONPATH. For the rest, only PyXML is required; no globus, no certificates,
no LCG/LFC libraries... are needed.

You also need to set the DLI endpoint to use, either as a command line option
or a environmental variable, or as an argument to an API function. Please read
the documentation.


On documentation
----------------
All python modules and scripts (CLI tools) here contained are
self-documented. This documentation can be accessed in the following ways:

  - Online help for python modules, in the python interpreter:
    >>> import my_module
    >>> help(my_module)
    
  - Online help for scripts (CLI tools):
    $> my_command -h

  - HTML documentation for python modules:
    It can by created with the "epydoc" package (from http://epydoc.sourceforge.net).
    Copy the interesting modules in a directory, and run:
       epydoc --html <modules_dir>/*
    A folder called "html" will be created with the necessary files. The one called
    "index.html" can be loaded in a browser and has links to the rest.

  - Read the docstrings directly from the source files.

  - The CLI tools use the API, so please check the scripts source code for some
    examples on API usage.
