"""
 This module implements a CMS Dataset Location Service (DLS) client
 interface as defined by the dlsApi module. This implementation relies
 on a DLS server embedded in the CMS Dataset Bookkeeping System (DBS).

 With DBS as back-end, the namespace of fileblocks is shared between
 DLS and DBS, and since it makes more sense that this is handled through
 DBS interfaces (with information regarding datasets, etc.), some of
 the methods of the DLS API are not implemented or present a limited
 functionality in this implementation. For example, the FileBlocks
 themselves cannot be created through this API, and the
 renameFileBlock method is not implemented.

 Such particularities are documented in every method.
 
 The module contains the DlsDbsApi class that implements most of the
 methods defined in dlsApi.DlsApi class and a couple of extra convenient
 (implementation specific) methods. Python applications interacting with
 a DBS-embedded DLS will instantiate a DlsDbsApi object and use its
 methods.

  """
  This class is an implementation of the DLS client interface, defined by
  the dlsApi.DlsApi class. This implementation relies on DLS information
  being embedded in the CMS Dataset Bookkeeping System (DBS).

  Unless specified, all methods that can raise an exception will raise one
  derived from DlsApiError.
  """

  def __init__(self, dls_endpoint=None, verbosity=dlsApi.DLS_VERB_WARN, **kwd):
    """
    Constructor of the class. It creates a DBS interface object using the
    specified dls_endpoint and optionally additional parameters in **kwd. 
    It also sets the verbosity of the DLS API.
    
    Any additional arguments for the DBS interface may be specified as part
    of **kwd. Otherwise they may be specified in a DBS configuration 
    file (see below). For every case, the arguments in the configuration
    file take less precedence.

    At the time of writing, the minimum argument required to build the DBS
    interface is the DBS server endpoint. For others, please check DBS
    client documentation.
    
    The server endpoint is got from a string in the URL form, usually:
    "http[s]://hname[:port]/path/to/DLS". This API tries to retrieve that
    value from several sources (in this order):   
         - specified dls_endpoint 
         - DLS_ENDPOINT environmental variable
         - specified URL argument (in **kwd)
         - specified URL in the configuration file (see below)
         - DLS catalog advertised in the Information System (if implemented)
         
    Any other DBS-specific parameter can be specified in the following ways
    (in order of precedence):
         - variable within **kwd (version, for the DBS client version)
         - variable within the DBS configuration file
    
    The DBS configuration file (see DBS documentation) will be passed to the
    DBS interface. It can specify server endpoint, logging level, and other
    variables, but it is overwritten by values specified by other means 
    (as explained above). The config file will be searched in (in this order):
       - specified dbs_client_config argument (in **kwd)
       - DBS_CLIENT_CONFIG environmental variable
    
    If the necessary arguments cannot be obtained in any of these ways, the
    instantiation is denied and a DlsConfigError is raised.
 
    The verbosity level affects invocations of all methods in this object.
    See the dlsApi.DlsApi.setVerbosity method for information on accepted values.
    The underlying DBS interface verbosity can be controlled via the corresponding
    DBS configuration parameter (in **kwd or config file).
      
    If the checkEndpoint (**kwd) is set to True, the provided endpoint is
    checked. This makes sense where more than one query are to be made next.
    For simple queries, any error in the endpoint will be noticed in the query
    itself, so the check would be redundant and not efficient.

    Fileblocks in DBS can be created only through DBS interface, not through DLS

    FileBlock attribute.
