User tests
----------
The TestDlsPhedexApi.py and TestDlsDbsApi.py scripts are runnable tests
to check basic functionality of the DLS Client CLI and API. They can
be used to test that a new installation works. The first script
can be used with a PhEDEx-based DLS back-end and the second with
a DBS-based DLS back-end. 

Both scripts may need some modification to run correctly; please check
their help option for more information:
  TestDlsPhedexApi.py -h
  TestDlsDbsApi.py -h


Functionality tests
-------------------
The FunctionalityTests directory contains a more complete functionality
test suite for different DLS back-ends. This is however only intended
for developers use. Please read the README file within this directory
for more information.
